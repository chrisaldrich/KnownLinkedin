Linkedin Support for Known
==========================

This plugin provides LinkedIn syndication (POSSE) support for Known articles, status updates and images.

Installation
------------

* Drop the Facebook folder into the IndoPlugins folder of your idno installation.
* Log into known and click on Administration.
* Click "install" on the plugins page

Known issues
------------

* LinkedIn has stupidly conservative rate limits on their API, so you may only be able to syndicate a handful of posts to LinkedIn within a 24 hour period. Choose wisely.
* LinkedIn's status update API doesn't (seem to) provide a permalink to the newly created update.

Uses
----

* PHP-OAuth2 <https://github.com/adoy/PHP-OAuth2> by Pierrick Charron, so be sure to clone --recursive
