Linkedin Support for Known
==========================

This plugin provides LinkedIn syndication (POSSE) support for Known articles, status updates and images.

Installation
------------

* Drop the Linkedin folder into the IdnoPlugins folder of your Known installation.
* Log into Known and navigate to Site configuration > Plugins.
* Enable the LinkedIn plugin on the Plugins page.

Known issues
------------

* LinkedIn has stupidly conservative rate limits on their API, so you may only be able to syndicate a handful of posts to LinkedIn within a 24 hour period. Choose wisely.

Uses
----

* PHP-OAuth2 <https://github.com/adoy/PHP-OAuth2> by Pierrick Charron, so be sure to ```clone --recursive```
